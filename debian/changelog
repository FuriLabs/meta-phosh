meta-phosh (11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * phosh-core: Drop purple-lurch.
    Chatty recommends it so it's pulled in by default.
  * phosh-core: Allow phosh-osk-stub as on screen keyboard.
    The default is squeekbard but architectures that have trouble building
    Rust (or one gtk-rs) can still use the metapackge.
  * phosh-core: Suggest systemd-coredump.
    We mention it all around but don't give uses any hint
    via the packagig system yet.
  * d/control: Suggest firefox-esr-mobile-config.
    This give a hint that it exists without pulling in firefox-esr itself.
  * phosh-core: Prefer pipewire over pulse.
    It's the future so let's prep for that.
  * Use gnome-bluetooth-sendto.
    Move to Recommends while at that as it's not super critical
    (Closes: #1030128)

  * d/control: Add gnome-usage.
    It's the recommended way to kill frozen GUI apps
  * Make chatty a dependency again. It supports libsoup3 now.

meta-phosh (9) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Debian Janitor ]
  * Trim trailing whitespace.

  [ Arnaud Ferraris ]
  * phosh-full: recommend phosh-plugins & phosh-mobile-settings
  * phosh-phone: downgrade `wys` to Recommends.
    So far, `wys` is only useful on the Librem 5, other platforms don't need
    it as audio routing for calls is all done in hardware. It should
    therefore be possible to uninstall (or not install at all) `wys` on
    those devices without breaking the whole metapackage stack.
  * phosh-full: drop `phosh-mobile-settings`
    It is now a recommended package for `phosh-core`, no need to have it
    twice.
  * d/control: update my email address

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * d/control: Add phosh-{mobile-settings,tour} to phosh-core.
    We do this as Recommends: so people can drop it if not wanted

 -- Arnaud Ferraris <aferraris@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Oct 2022 15:36:08 +0200

meta-phosh (8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/control: Move chatty to recommends.
    Don't let chatty block the libsoup3 transition but also avoid that the
    whole phone stack gets removed.
  * Bump standards version to 4.6.1

meta-phosh (7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * phosh-core: Drop phosh-osk-stub dependency for mipsel
    `squeekboard` couldn't be built for mipsel for a while, so we needed to
    depend on `phosh-osk-stub` on this architecture. As this is no longer
    the case and the latter package has been dropped, let's make
    `squeekboard` the only dependency.
  * d/control: rename `kgx` to `gnome-console`
    Upstream renamed their software over the past development cycle, and the
    Debian package has been renamed to `gnome-console` accordingly. Make
    sure this is reflected here.

meta-phosh (6) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Arnaud Ferraris ]
  * d/control: fix phosh-games long description (Closes: #974642)

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * phosh-core: Allow for pipewire too (Closes: #1002874)
  * phosh-phone: Drop purple-mm-sms.
    Chatty as of 0.4.0 supports sms natively
  * phosh-phone: Depend on mmsd-tng.
    This enables mms support in chatty once 0.5.0 enters unstable.
  * Document changes and release 6

meta-phosh (5) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Henry-Nicolas Tourneur ]
  * d/control: skip squeekboard on mipsel for now since it is not building

 -- Guido Günther <agx@sigxcpu.org>  Tue, 24 Nov 2020 11:38:16 +0100

meta-phosh (4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/control: create phosh-tablet
    chatty is therefore removed from `phosh-full`, as it's a dependency to
    both `phosh-phone` and `phosh-tablet`.
  * d/control: Add lollypop to phosh-full instead of rhythmbox-plugins
    `rhythmbox` doesn't have an adaptive UI, and as such doesn't fit phone
    screens. `lollypop` would be a better fit as it's adaptive.
  * d/control: improve long descriptions and bump Standards-Version.
    Fixes: lintian: out-of-date-standards-version
    Fixes: lintian: spelling-error-in-description
    Fixes: lintian: extended-description-line-too-long

meta-phosh (3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/control: Move chatty from phosh-core to phosh-{phone,full} phone needs
    it for SMS and we want it as IM client on e.g. tablets too that don't use
    phosh-phone.
  * d/control: Add kgx to phone-full. The full environment must have kgx.
  * d/control: Depend on squeekboard. It's available now too
  * d/changelog: Enable piuparts. We have all deps in now.

 -- Guido Günther <agx@sigxcpu.org>  Fri, 30 Oct 2020 10:43:26 +0100

meta-phosh (2) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Henry-Nicolas Tourneur ]
  * d/conrol: Add phosh-core dependencies on gnome-session-{bin,common}
    Phosh recommends those packages, we want to depend on those for the
    session to work.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * salsa-ci: Disable piuparts check.
    The check can't pass until we have all the dependencies in
    unstable so disable it for the moment.
  * Fix gnome-calls naming
  * Move squeekboard to Recommends:
    Move it to Recommends until it left NEW.
  * Move chatty to recommends.
    Drop the dependency until it's out of NEW

 -- Guido Günther <agx@sigxcpu.org>  Tue, 20 Oct 2020 10:44:58 +0200

meta-phosh (1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release. Heavily based on gnome-meta3.
