meta-phosh (7) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Arnaud Ferraris ]
  * d/control: fix phosh-games long description (Closes: #974642)

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * phosh-core: Allow for pipewire too (Closes: #1002874)
  * phosh-phone: Drop purple-mm-sms.
    Chatty as of 0.4.0 supports sms natively
  * phosh-phone: Depend on mmsd-tng.
    This enables mms support in chatty once 0.5.0 enters unstable.
  * Document changes and release 6

  [ Henry-Nicolas Tourneur ]
  * d/control: skip squeekboard on mipsel for now since it is not building

meta-phosh (4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/control: create phosh-tablet
    chatty is therefore removed from `phosh-full`, as it's a dependency to
    both `phosh-phone` and `phosh-tablet`.
  * d/control: Add lollypop to phosh-full instead of rhythmbox-plugins
    `rhythmbox` doesn't have an adaptive UI, and as such doesn't fit phone
    screens. `lollypop` would be a better fit as it's adaptive.
  * d/control: improve long descriptions and bump Standards-Version.
    Fixes: lintian: out-of-date-standards-version
    Fixes: lintian: spelling-error-in-description
    Fixes: lintian: extended-description-line-too-long

meta-phosh (3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/control: Move chatty from phosh-core to phosh-{phone,full} phone needs
    it for SMS and we want it as IM client on e.g. tablets too that don't use
    phosh-phone.
  * d/control: Add kgx to phone-full. The full environment must have kgx.
  * d/control: Depend on squeekboard. It's available now too
  * d/changelog: Enable piuparts. We have all deps in now.

meta-phosh (2) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Henry-Nicolas Tourneur ]
  * d/conrol: Add phosh-core dependencies on gnome-session-{bin,common}
    Phosh recommends those packages, we want to depend on those for the
    session to work.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * salsa-ci: Disable piuparts check.
    The check can't pass until we have all the dependencies in
    unstable so disable it for the moment.
  * Fix gnome-calls naming
  * Move squeekboard to Recommends:
    Move it to Recommends until it left NEW.
  * Move chatty to recommends.
    Drop the dependency until it's out of NEW
