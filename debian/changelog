  * d/control: Move chatty from phosh-core to phosh-{phone,full} phone needs
    it for SMS and we want it as IM client on e.g. tablets too that don't use
    phosh-phone.

meta-phosh (2) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Henry-Nicolas Tourneur ]
  * d/conrol: Add phosh-core dependencies on gnome-session-{bin,common}
    Phosh recommends those packages, we want to depend on those for the
    session to work.

  [ Guido G端nther ]
  * salsa-ci: Disable piuparts check.
    The check can't pass until we have all the dependencies in
    unstable so disable it for the moment.
  * Fix gnome-calls naming
  * Move squeekboard to Recommends:
    Move it to Recommends until it left NEW.
  * Move chatty to recommends.
    Drop the dependency until it's out of NEW
