meta-phosh (37) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Sync versions with current phosh release
  * phosh-phone: Recommend location services.
    Location information is relevant for mapping, etc. While individual apps
    should have a dependency we can well expect it to be present by default
    on a phone.
  * phosh-core: Recommend phog.
    Most people want a DisplayManager instead of the systemd unit.

meta-phosh (31) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Evangelos Ribeiro Tzaras ]
  * phosh-core: Fix bluetooth PA/PW conditional dependency.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * d/control: Move xdg-desktop-portal-gtk from phosh-full to core.
    Portals are increasingly used even outside containers (e.g. in GTK4 for
    file dialogs) so make sure we have a portal installed.
  * d/control: Add xdg-desktop-portal-wlr.
    Needed for screenshots and screencasts
  * d/control: Ensure recent versions of pho*
    E.g. Phosh 0.31.0 can run with older phoc but phoc 0.31.0 fixes bugs in
    0.30.0 so version that dependency to help partial upgrades.
  * d/control: Version pipewire dependency.
    Require a version that gives us suitable audio icons
  * gitignore debian build directories
  * Add homepage field

meta-phosh (29) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Chris Talbot ]
  * d/control: Recommend phosh-antispam

  [ Arnaud Ferraris ]
  * Add `phosh-pim` and re-organize packages.
    The current `phosh-tablet` package feels awkward as it depends on
    GNOME packages which are useful on any device. It would be best to
    create into `phosh-pim` which would pull contacts/calendar/tasks
    management apps, and make the latter a dependency of `phosh-full`.
    `phosh-tablet` is kept as it may still be useful in the future, but now
    only depends on `phosh-core`.
    `phosh-phone`, on the other hand, should depend only on phone-specific
    components (calls/SMS/MMS) and pull in `phosh-pim` as well as PIM is an
    important part of phone usage.
    `phosh-full` now depends only on `phosh-pim` and suggests `phosh-phone`,
    without making it a dependency or recommend, so that the latter must
    always be explicitly installed on devices where it's relevant.
  * d/control: bump Standards-Version, no change required

 -- Arnaud Ferraris <aferraris@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Jul 2023 23:30:18 +0200

meta-phosh (27) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Upload to experimental
  * d/control: Bump versions.
    Require Phosh 0.27.0 and GNOME 44
  * phosh-phone: Suggest phosh-antispam and vvmplayer.
    Both are very useful on phones

 -- Guido Günther <agx@sigxcpu.org>  Tue, 02 May 2023 11:38:47 +0200

meta-phosh (24) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Make the meta package version match the Phosh's middle version number.
    As several of Phosh components (phosh, phoc, phosh-mobile-settings,
    phosh-tour, …) adjusted to the same version scheme let's use that
    here too. We drop the leading 0. to avoid an epoch (we can introduce
    that once Phosh switches to 1.x).
    Updates to the metapackage will be numbered 24+1, 24+2, etc.
  * Version important components so they're up to date on partial upgrades.

 -- Guido Günther <agx@sigxcpu.org>  Wed, 01 Feb 2023 13:55:36 +0100

meta-phosh (11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * phosh-core: Drop purple-lurch.
    Chatty recommends it so it's pulled in by default.
  * phosh-core: Allow phosh-osk-stub as on screen keyboard.
    The default is squeekbard but architectures that have trouble building
    Rust (or one gtk-rs) can still use the metapackage.
  * phosh-core: Suggest systemd-coredump.
    We mention it all around but don't give uses any hint
    via the packagig system yet.
  * d/control: Suggest firefox-esr-mobile-config.
    This give a hint that it exists without pulling in firefox-esr itself.
  * phosh-core: Prefer pipewire over pulse.
    It's the future so let's prep for that.
  * Use gnome-bluetooth-sendto.
    Move to Recommends while at that as it's not super critical
    (Closes: #1030128)

 -- Guido Günther <agx@sigxcpu.org>  Tue, 31 Jan 2023 14:06:07 +0100

meta-phosh (10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/control: Add gnome-usage.
    It's the recommended way to kill frozen GUI apps
  * Make chatty a dependency again. It supports libsoup3 now.

 -- Guido Günther <agx@sigxcpu.org>  Sun, 22 Jan 2023 20:14:23 +0100

meta-phosh (9) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Debian Janitor ]
  * Trim trailing whitespace.

  [ Arnaud Ferraris ]
  * phosh-full: recommend phosh-plugins & phosh-mobile-settings
  * phosh-phone: downgrade `wys` to Recommends.
    So far, `wys` is only useful on the Librem 5, other platforms don't need
    it as audio routing for calls is all done in hardware. It should
    therefore be possible to uninstall (or not install at all) `wys` on
    those devices without breaking the whole metapackage stack.
  * phosh-full: drop `phosh-mobile-settings`
    It is now a recommended package for `phosh-core`, no need to have it
    twice.
  * d/control: update my email address

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * d/control: Add phosh-{mobile-settings,tour} to phosh-core.
    We do this as Recommends: so people can drop it if not wanted

 -- Arnaud Ferraris <aferraris@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Oct 2022 15:36:08 +0200

meta-phosh (8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/control: Move chatty to recommends.
    Don't let chatty block the libsoup3 transition but also avoid that the
    whole phone stack gets removed.
  * Bump standards version to 4.6.1

 -- Guido Günther <agx@sigxcpu.org>  Mon, 29 Aug 2022 13:15:42 +0200

meta-phosh (7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * phosh-core: Drop phosh-osk-stub dependency for mipsel
    `squeekboard` couldn't be built for mipsel for a while, so we needed to
    depend on `phosh-osk-stub` on this architecture. As this is no longer
    the case and the latter package has been dropped, let's make
    `squeekboard` the only dependency.
  * d/control: rename `kgx` to `gnome-console`
    Upstream renamed their software over the past development cycle, and the
    Debian package has been renamed to `gnome-console` accordingly. Make
    sure this is reflected here.

meta-phosh (6) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Arnaud Ferraris ]
  * d/control: fix phosh-games long description (Closes: #974642)

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * phosh-core: Allow for pipewire too (Closes: #1002874)
  * phosh-phone: Drop purple-mm-sms.
    Chatty as of 0.4.0 supports sms natively
  * phosh-phone: Depend on mmsd-tng.
    This enables mms support in chatty once 0.5.0 enters unstable.
  * Document changes and release 6

meta-phosh (5) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Henry-Nicolas Tourneur ]
  * d/control: skip squeekboard on mipsel for now since it is not building

 -- Guido Günther <agx@sigxcpu.org>  Tue, 24 Nov 2020 11:38:16 +0100

meta-phosh (4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/control: create phosh-tablet
    chatty is therefore removed from `phosh-full`, as it's a dependency to
    both `phosh-phone` and `phosh-tablet`.
  * d/control: Add lollypop to phosh-full instead of rhythmbox-plugins
    `rhythmbox` doesn't have an adaptive UI, and as such doesn't fit phone
    screens. `lollypop` would be a better fit as it's adaptive.
  * d/control: improve long descriptions and bump Standards-Version.
    Fixes: lintian: out-of-date-standards-version
    Fixes: lintian: spelling-error-in-description
    Fixes: lintian: extended-description-line-too-long

 -- Arnaud Ferraris <arnaud.ferraris@gmail.com>  Mon, 16 Nov 2020 23:01:32 +0100

meta-phosh (3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/control: Move chatty from phosh-core to phosh-{phone,full} phone needs
    it for SMS and we want it as IM client on e.g. tablets too that don't use
    phosh-phone.
  * d/control: Add kgx to phone-full. The full environment must have kgx.
  * d/control: Depend on squeekboard. It's available now too
  * d/changelog: Enable piuparts. We have all deps in now.

 -- Guido Günther <agx@sigxcpu.org>  Fri, 30 Oct 2020 10:43:26 +0100

meta-phosh (2) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Henry-Nicolas Tourneur ]
  * d/conrol: Add phosh-core dependencies on gnome-session-{bin,common}
    Phosh recommends those packages, we want to depend on those for the
    session to work.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * salsa-ci: Disable piuparts check.
    The check can't pass until we have all the dependencies in
    unstable so disable it for the moment.
  * Fix gnome-calls naming
  * Move squeekboard to Recommends:
    Move it to Recommends until it left NEW.
  * Move chatty to recommends.
    Drop the dependency until it's out of NEW

 -- Guido Günther <agx@sigxcpu.org>  Tue, 20 Oct 2020 10:44:58 +0200

meta-phosh (1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release. Heavily based on gnome-meta3.
